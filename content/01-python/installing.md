# Introduction

This class will introduce the basics of the python programming
language and the libraries used for scientific computing.


## Getting python

You will want to install python and the associated libraries on your
laptop that you can bring to the seminar.

On Linux machines, you probably already have python and you can get
the needed libraries through your system package manager.

For Mac and Windows, I recommend the free Anaconda distribution:

https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

This will install everything that you need.

If you have trouble getting a local install working, most of the class
material will work automatically in the cloud, either on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [google
colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).

If you have python successfully installed, you should be able to start
the python interpreter at the command line as: `python`.  A shell will
come up, and you can try out your first program:

```
print("hello, world")
```


## Following along in class

All of the class notes are hosted as Jupyter notebooks on github:

https://github.com/sbu-python-class/python-science

these are rendered by [Jupyter
book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) into a webpage that allows
you to see the rendered notebooks as well as launch the notebooks in
the cloud:

````{note}
Some notebooks use [MyST Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/myst.html) to 
allow for more styling.  To see these styles, you need to install `jupyterlab-myst`, which
can be done via:
```
pip install jupyterlab_myst
```
