# Packaging



Let's look at the structure of creating an installable python package.

```{note}
The python packaging system is constantly evolving, and the current recommendations
of tools is list here: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/
```

## Our example

We'll work on an example that builds on the Mandelbrot set exercise
from our matplotlib discussion.  Our example is hosted here:

https://github.com/sbu-python-class/mymodule

On your local computer, if you have `git` installed, you can clone this via:

```
git clone https://github.com/sbu-python-class/mymodule.git
```

The directory structure appears as:

```
mymodule
├── mymodule
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── mandel.py
└── README.md
```

This is a rather common way of structuring a project:

* The top-level `mymodule` directory is not part of the python
  package, but instead is where the source control (e.g. git) begins,
  and also hosts setup files that are used for installation

* `mymodule/mymodule` is the actual python module that we will load.

   ```{important}
   To make python recognize this as a module, we need an `__init__.py`
   file there&mdash;it can be completely empty.
   ```
   
* The actual `*.py` files that make up our module are in `mymodule/mymodule`

Right now, this package does not appear in our python search path, so
the only way to load it is to work in the top-level `mymodule/`
directory, and then we can do:

```python
import mymodule.mandel
```

we could also do:

```python
from mymodule.mandel import mandelbrot
```


## setuptools

A popular set of packages are:

* Installation:

  * `pip` to install packages from PyPI
  * `conda` for disctribution cross-platform software stacks

* Packaging tools:

  * `setuptools` to create source distributions
  * `build` for binary distributions
  * `twine` to upload to PyPI

We'll look at how to use [`setuptools`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html) to package our library.

```{note}
A lot of setuptools documentation is out-of-date and
inconsistent with the packaging guidelines.

Packages used to create a `setup.py` file that had all of the project information,
but this is deprecated.  Instead we should create a `pyproject.toml` file---this
is consistent with [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/).
```

Here's a first `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(name='mymodule',
      description='test module for PHY 546',
      url='https://github.com/sbu-python-class/mymodule',
      author='Michael Zingale',
      author_email='michael.zingale@stonybrook.edu',
      license='BSD',
      packages=find_packages(),
      install_requires=['numpy', 'matplotlib'])
```

```{note}
The packaging ecosystem is always evolving.  There are 2 special config files that can
help customize the package and contain the defaults for other tools: `setup.cfg` and
`pyproject.toml`.  See:

* [Configuring setuptools using `setup.cfg` files](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html)

* [Configuring setuptools using `pyproject.toml` files](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html)
```

## Installing

We can use setup in a variety of ways.  Two useful ways are:

* Install:

  `python setup.py install --user`

  This will copy the source files into your install location (likely
  `~/.local/...`) putting them into your python search path.  Then you
  can use this package from anywhere.

* Development mode (https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html):

  `python setup.py develop --user`

  This doesn't actually install anything in your user- or site-wide
  install location, but instead it creates a special link in that
  install directory back to your actual project code.

  This allows you to continue to develop the package without needed to
  re-install each time you change the source.

  You can uninstall via:

  `pip uninstall mymodule`

The above put the package in the user-specific install location
(because of the `--user` flag).  If you leave this off, it will try to
install in the system-wide path, which might require admin privileges.


## Using our module

Once the module is installed, we can use it from any directory.  For example, if we do:

```python
import mymodule
print(mymodule.__file__)
```

it shows us where the module is installed on our system.  In my case, it is:

```
/home/zingale/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mymodule-0.0.0-py3.11.egg/mymodule/__init__.py
```

Let's generate a plot:

```
from mymodule.mandel import mandelbrot
fig = mandelbrot(128)
fig.savefig("test.png")
```

This produces the plot shown below:
